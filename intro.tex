\section{Introduction}
Creative solutions are necessary to meet the \gls{SNF} disposal challenges 
faced by the United States.
This work proposes and evaluates a strategy that leverages the 
remaining resources inherent in a shut down nuclear reactor site toward a new 
purpose:a spent fuel repository facility.

Domestic nuclear power plants are at risk of shutdown in areas with surplus 
electricity capacity from coal and new natural gas. Kewaunee and Crystal River 
have already closed  and numerous other plants are at risk in the near term 
\cite{nei_nuclear_2016}.  Simultaneously, the \gls{DOE} 
has begun to move forward with consent-based siting of a nuclear 
spent fuel repository \cite{doe_designing_2016}. The proposed solution in this 
work seeks to combine these efforts toward a more economic and politically 
feasible solution. 

% explain that this work compares the base case with the proposal
This work considers the potential benefits of siting a borehole-type reposiotry 
at the site of a shut down nuclear power plant.  The  expected benefits of this 
proposed integrated siting strategy include reduced radioactive waste 
transportation burden, increased likelihood of consent from the local 
community, and improved expediency acheived through leveraging existing 
infrastructure and skill.

% note the metrics on which these two cases are being compared.
The siting strategy will be compared to a reference case at 
Yucca Mountain through quantitative metrics. The incentives of various 
stakeholders will also be modeled as a weighted linear sum of these 
metrics. 

\subsection{Motivation}
The proposed integrated siting strategy takes advantage of three technical 
benefits of borehole repository designs: modularity, broad geological 
suitability, and footprint efficiency. Modularity enables regional repositories 
to scale in size according to the local spent fuel burden. 
Additionally, the necessary geological characteristics required for borehole 
disposal, crystalline basement rocks at $2,000 m - 5,000 m$ deep, are relatively 
common in stable continental regions \cite{arnold_research_2012}. Finally, the 
surface footprint requirements of a borehole repository are comparable to the 
available footprint of a nuclear power reactor site, with only $30 km^2$ 
required for the total \gls{SNF} amount proposed for Yucca Mountain 
\cite{brady_deep_2009}.

Integrated siting also has potential economic benefits. One significant cost 
inherent to borehole repository concepts is the repacking of spent fuel 
assemblies into smaller-diameter waste canisters representing over 15\% of 
estimated per-borehole cost \cite{arnold_reference_2011}.  However, siting a 
repository at a non-operating power plant facility, especially one with a 
dry-cask storage site, will take advantage of already existing infrastructure 
and local human talent for spent fuel handling and packaging. Many candidate 
non-operating reactor sites, such as those mapped in Figure \ref{fig:shutdown}, 
may be appropriate for integrated siting if they are located above crystalline 
basement formations and include dry cask packaging facilities.

\end{figure}

Finally, integrated siting may be more practically and politically feasible. 
Preliminary work \cite{waleed_regional_2015} indicates integrated siting is 
appealing to many stakeholder groups. For example, a consent-based approval 
process may be feasible because communities local to power plants may be 
uniquely receptive to the incentives of hosting a repository. 

This paper seeks to quantify the impact of these and other features of the 
proposed siting strategy.

\section{Methodology}

This work will evaluate \textbf{2 scenarios} for repository siting according to \textbf{6 metrics} of 
performance considered from the perspective of \textbf{4 stakeholders.}

Preliminary work \cite{waleed_regional_2015} suggests that integrated siting 
will reduce costs, construction, time (both for construction and licensing), 
transportation distances, and resistance from the local community.  
The goal of this paper is to compare this siting strategy with the 
business-as-usual base case via quantitative metrics capturing the key 
priorities of stakeholders. Accordingly, the present 
work will compare three siting scenarios along these axes. 

\begin{itemize}
        \item The reference case: a standalone borehole repository at Yucca Mountain.  
        \item The proposed case: a repository sited at a shutdown reactor site 
                in the Midwest.

\end{itemize}

 This work will evaluate the potential impacts of each siting strategy according 
to the following 6 quantitative measures:

\begin{itemize}
        \item Transportation Burden $[MTHM \cdot km]$: A site is preferred by 
                most stakeholders if it can minimize the distance \gls{SNF} 
                must travel.
        \item Workforce Utilization $[-]$: A repository site is preferred by 
                many stakeholders if it utilizes an already situated skilled local 
                workforce. 
        \item Expediency $[y]$: Many stakeholders will benefit if the removal 
                of dry casks from current storage pads is expedited.
        \item Consent Basis $[\frac{MW}{\mbox{capita}}]$: If there is a basis for a consent-based 
                siting process to succeed, many stakeholders benefit.
        \item Site Access $[-]$: Rail access to the site is essential for 
                beginning operations.
        \item Site Appropriateness $[-]$: A site must be geologically 
                appropriate, of sufficient area, etc.
\end{itemize}

Finally, recognizing that these measures are valued differently by each, we
consider possible weighting factors that may capture the perspectives of 4 key
stakeholder groups:

\begin{itemize}
        \item the federal government,
        \item the state government,
        \item the local community / government,
        \item and the owner of the non-operating plant.
\end{itemize}
